		<h2> Swotinsky's Favorite Dive Sites</h2>
		
		<h3> Bonaire </h3>
		<p> Bonaire is an island in the southern Caribean Sea.  Many reefs in Bonaire are so close to the shore, you don't even need a boat to see them!  Swotinsky's favorite dive site in Bonaire is "Karpata".
		
		<h3> Roatan </h3>
		<p> Roatan is one of the bay islands off the coast of Honduras.  Hundreds of years ago, Roatan was a pirate haven.  Now it is a world-class dive destination.  Swotinsky's favorite dive site in Roatan is "Hole-In-The-Wall."
		
		<h3> Cozumel </h3>
		<p> Cozumel is an island off the coast of Mexico.  In addition to Cozumel's awesome ocean dive sites, scuba divers can also go cavern-diving in fresh water cenotes.  Swotinsky's favorite dive site in Cozumel is "Palancar Caves"</p>
		
		<h3> Cocos Island </h3>
		<p> Cocos Island is located approximately 300 miles off the coast of Costa Rica.  It is famous for huge sea life like hammerhead sharks.  To dive Cocos Island, many divers spend a week on a live-aboard board.  Swotinsky has never been to Cocos Island but he hopes to someday! </p>
